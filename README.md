Focuses on tile-based worlds, procedural generation, player physics, and clean engine-style architecture.

## Features

- Tile-based 2D world
- Procedural terrain generation (FastNoise2 / Perlin-style noise)
- Player movement, gravity, and collision
- Sprite-based rendering with animation
- Chunked world layout (scales beyond screen size)
- Separation of rendering, physics, and world logic

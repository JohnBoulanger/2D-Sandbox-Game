A tile-based 2D sandbox game engine built from scratch in C++ using SFML.
The project focuses on real-time rendering, dynamic world modification, collision handling, and clean engine-style architecture. Sprites are gathered from an open source terraria asset pack

## Features

- Tile-based 2D world representation
- Procedural terrain generation using noise functions
- Real-time player movement, gravity, and collision detection
- Sprite-based rendering with animation support
- Chunked world layout for scalable maps
- Interactive terrain editing with immediate world updates
- Clear separation of rendering, physics, input, and world logic

## Tech Stack

- Language: C++17
- Graphics: SFML (2.6.x)
- Build System: CMake
- Noise Generation: FastNoise2
